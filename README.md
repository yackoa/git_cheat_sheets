### Delete file from you remote repo
1. In the command-line, navigate to your local repository.
2. Ensure you are in the default branch:
`git checkout master`
3. The rm -r command will recursively remove your folder:
`git rm -r folder-name`
4. Commit the change:
`it commit -m "Remove duplicated directory"`
5. Push the change to your remote repository:
`git push origin master`
